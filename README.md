### Hi, I'm AbooMinister25

#### I'm 14 years old, and I mostly code in python. I've made several things, such as

- A Programming Language
- A Discord Bot
- A Virtual Assistant
- A Password Manager (I don't actually use it though, it was mostly just for fun)
- A Website For My Discord. [Check it out](https://infinitespammers.netlify.app)


#### And theres my current project, a programming language called Lite. I'm pretty new to this, so feel free to check out the repository and give me suggestions.

#### There are other projects I've done as well, but I don't want to clutter this up, so yeah, you've gotten this far, so thanks for reading!
